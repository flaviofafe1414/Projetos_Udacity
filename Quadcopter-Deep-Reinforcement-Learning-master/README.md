# Deep RL Quadcopter Controller
## Project: Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree - Reinforcement Learning 
## Overview: 
The goal of this project is to train a quadcopter to fly with a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, specifically it is trained how to take-off. For the algorithm, we use a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG).
#### Final Result :
